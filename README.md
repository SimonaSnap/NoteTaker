# Note Taker
[![PyPi license](https://badgen.net/pypi/license/pip/)](https://pypi.com/project/pip/)
## Description 
The user is allowed to take, save and delete notes in this application. When the user has included both title and body in the note, a save icon appears that will then append the note to the saved note list on the left side of the screen. If the user clicks on the text of a saved note, then that note shall appear, and if the user clicks on the trash can icon found to the right of the note in the note list, then that note shall disappear. All the information stays even after reloading the screen
